# Store App
A simple store app to manage products, customers, suppliers, and orders.

## Session Persistence (Auth)
Firebase Auth automatically maintains sessions. When the user logs in, Firebase saves the user's session and automatically restores it when the app is reopened. The session is only cleared when the user explicitly logs out.
